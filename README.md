# Learn Unreal Engine 5 C++ Programming by Creating an Action-RPG Style Open World Game

I’m currently taking the [Unreal Engine 5: The Ultimate Game Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) and developing an Action-RPG style open world game!

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to learn C++ programming in Unreal Engine 5 by building various game elements from scratch. The game will feature open-world maps, realistic environments using Quixel Bridge, dungeons, enemies with different weapons, destructible objects that spawn treasures, and more!

## Key Features

- **Enemy Behavior**: Implement behavior for various creature types, including gruntlings, raptors, insects, and golems.
- **Character Progression**: Develop the code for the character to pick up and equip weapons, fight stronger monsters, and collect loot.
- **New UE5 Features**: Utilize new Unreal Engine 5 features such as Motion Warping, Meta Sounds, and Niagara for visual effects.
- **Animations & Physics**: Create animation blueprints for enemies, use the Chaos destruction system for breakable objects, and create soul effects in Niagara.

## Progress

I have already made significant progress, including:
- **Environment**: Designed a level with nature, trees, plants, and an imported dungeon using UE5's Packed Level Instance feature.
- **Character**: Implemented a main character with weapon equipping and combat mechanics.
- **Enemies**: Added various enemy types with different attack patterns and behaviors.
- **UI**: Developed a main menu and HUD to display character health and resources.

## Conclusion

Join me on this journey, and let’s create something amazing together!
